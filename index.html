                Hi, I'm Rahul Singh Rautela, born and raised in Jaipur. I'm a Coder and Tech Enthusiast, passionate
                about
                exploring the ever-evolving world of technology. My current interests are centered around the
                transformative
                potential of AI, and I'm actively learning and discovering more about this exciting field. I aspire to
                leverage my passion for AI and my experience in DevOps to develop innovative AI-driven DevOps
                solutions.<br><br>
                Currently, I am working as a DevOps Intern at WatchGuard Technology, where I'm gaining hands-on
                experience
                with a variety of DevOps tools and methodologies, further enhancing my technical skillset.<br><br>
                Outside of work, I'm a huge football loverâ€”I stay up all night to watch my team win. I also enjoy
                watching
                movies and web series, and my favorite hobby is playing video games. On weekends, you'll find me in the
                kitchen, as I'm also a weekend chef, cooking up some basic dishes.</p>
